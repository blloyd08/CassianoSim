General components that make up the entire system and there description

1.  Chunker   - Takes in dough. Dough is removed in chunks at a given interval
2.  Elevator  - Raises bowl up to the chunker and allows dough to be added to chunker then returns the bowl to the ground
3.  Scrap Hop - The scrap hopper has two hoppers. A general hopper that holds all the dough that has not been weighed and a smaller hopepr that holds the weighed dough. If there is a bowl under the scrap hopper that needs scrap it will drop the weighed dough into the empty bowl. Then it will start cutting and weighing the next set of dough.
4.  Dosing    - This postion manages the ingredient draws. A set of liquids draw directly into the bowl. Bulk dry ingredients are drawn into a silo to be weighed and minor ingridents are drawn on a seporate system. When the bulk ingredients are finished drawing the minor ingredients transfer into the silo. When all drys are in the silo the silo is discharged into a bowl
5.  Mixers    - There are three mixers. Each mixer mixes a bowl for a set duration on low speed and then on high speed. Within the set of mixers, a mixer is chosen on availability. If more than one mixer is availabe then it goes by priority starting with mixer 1 and working towards mixer 3.
6.  Cycle Time- Cycle time is a global timer that prevents another bowl from starting mixing until a cooldown between when the last bowl started mixing has elapsed. Manipulating the cycle time is essential to controlling the freshness of the dough
7.  Robot     - Robot traverses between machines picking up and dropping off bowls
8.  HMI       - Computer that presents controls to the user to change settings
9.  Bowl      - Bowls hold dough and carry it though all of the machines
10. Dough     - Dough has a batch number and ingredients that make up the size of the dough
